Hi, welcome to my website!

I am Zhichen Xiong. You can call me Ella.

I come from China and this is my fifth year in the United States. Right now I am the first year master student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health

I like travelling, trying different kinds of food, singing in karaoke, and some sports like pingpang, badminton, and volleyball.
